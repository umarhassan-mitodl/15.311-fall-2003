**Kickoff of OP Team Project**

One of the main goals of this class is to give students the skills to observe, diagnose, and guide organizational change. One of the most valuable ways of achieving this end is by having student teams go out and study change initiatives in real organizational settings. In this session, we will introduce a major component of the class, the Organizational Processes Team Project.

Organizations undertake initiatives in order to further their strategic or tactical business goals. Your task is to analyze an initiative that was recently adopted, or is in the process of being adopted in an organization. Each team will identify an initiative, conduct a multi-perspective analysis, and relate it to what else is happening in the organization. The purpose of the assignment is to improve your ability to diagnose and tailor initiatives in ways that work.

**Understanding Ethical Violations, OR, Why Do Smart People Do Dumb Things?**

Of late, the business press has been replete with stories of unethical and illegal business dealings. In this session, we seek to gain insight into how it is that seemingly smart people can display such glaring lapses.

**Case:** Vandivier. "Why Should My Conscience Bother Me?"

**Strategic Design Perspective I: Organizational Structure and Processes**

The formal structure of the organization plays a critical role in shaping the work that gets done in organizations. There have evolved some general principles that managers tend to follow when designing organizations. While there is no universal "best way" to organize, depending on the purpose, there are better and worse ways to group, link and align organizational units. This Appex case provides an excellent setting in which to examine the tradeoffs one makes when designing formal organizational structures.

**Case:** _Appex Corporation_. Harvard Business School, 1992.

**Strategic Design Perspective II: Incentives and Alignment**

This is perhaps the most famous (or infamous) case of incentive structures in the management literature. It makes a sharp argument in favor of some controversial ways of designing compensations systems and motivating employees. The fact that these methods are controversial, however, should not make us dismissive. As we shall see, Lincoln and others have long used such reward systems with some interesting results. Be prepared to take a position on the reward system.

**Case:** Bjorkman, I. _Lincoln Electric in China._ INSEAD, 1999.

**Political Perspective I: Understanding Power and Authority**

A central theme in the political perspective on organizations is that understanding the nature of power, how to get it and how to use it, are essential for any manager to be effective. In order to motivate our discussion of power and authority, we will watch a short film reporting a series of classic experiments on obedience to authority.

**Case:** Milgram's _Obedience to Authority_ experiments.

**Cultural Perspective I: Culture as Control**   
     
Individual Case Analysis Assignment Handed Out -- DUE November 6{{< sup "  \n" >}}     
Today we will begin our discussion of culture and consider what it means for an organizational culture to be strong or weak. We will consider one useful model of organizational culture and see how it helps us better understand the Disney organization. And we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of strong cultures -- such as the one shown on the video for the session -- for employees, shareholders and customers.

Cohorts B, C and E meet 8:30-10:00     
Cohorts A, D, and F meet 10:20-11:50

In this special session, run jointly with the Career Development Office, we will turn our attention to the examination of careers. As organizations are changing rapidly, so too are the nature of and expectations for our careers. We will discuss the individual impacts of the structural shifts in the kinds of firms we have been studying during the course of the term and consider various strategies for managing your career in today's organizations.

**Cultural Perspective II:  Culture and Change**

Individual Assignment Due (Assigned on October 30)

Hand out Confidential Instructions for Negotiation Assignment (DUE: Nov. 13)

There is near universal agreement that managing change is one of the most difficult, but profoundly important, of management tasks. Cultural issues are often cited as a hindrance to change efforts. In this session, we will explore how understanding organizational culture is a crucial skill for changemakers. The case and the associated readings for this session highlight the tradeoffs that need to be considered when guiding organizational transformations.

Leadership is often viewed from the perspective of those at the top of the organization. In this class, we will consider ways in which insights from the three perspectives can help people at any level of the organization produce change.
